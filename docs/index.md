## Welcome
Soundboard is a program that helps you play sounds over your microphone with the use of hotkeys

## Before you start
This soundboard does not provide a __Virtual Audio Cable__ needed to pipe sounds from a output device to your microphone.
However, there are a number of free options out there, [here's one of them!](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm#DownloadCable)

## Setting up Audio Devices
Assuming you've downloaded my recommended Virtual Audio Cable, the most common setup is to have your __CABLE Output__ as your default recording device, with your microphone set to "Listen to this device" with your __CABLE Input__. 
Your speakers should still be the same, set to being the default device as well.

To use the "Listen to this device" on your microphone, go to your Recording Devices tab and right click your microphone. Hit properties, and go to the listen tab. Check the "Listen to this device" box and set the output to __CABLE Input__.
