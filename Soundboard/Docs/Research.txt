"Listen to this device" and device selector in the recording device properties. (reverse engineered)

- Two options in the property store, a checkbox for "Listen to this device" and a DropDownList for choosing the target, or the playback device that listens
- Base key name: 24dbb0fc-9311-4b3d-9cf0-18ff155639d4, presumably the GUID of the "Listen" tab.

- There are 3 possible "sub-keys", where it has an extra number at the end of the key. Presumably for each setting 
	> 24dbb0fc-9311-4b3d-9cf0-18ff155639d4/1, boolean for the "Listen to this device" checkbox. (true for checked)
	> 24dbb0fc-9311-4b3d-9cf0-18ff155639d4/2, boolean for the "Power management" options. (True for "Disable automatically to save power")
	> 24dbb0fc-9311-4b3d-9cf0-18ff155639d4/0, if this exists then it is a string of the device id that was selected as the listen target.
		~ Some other computers don't have the 0 at the end with the same base GUID. Need more testing to see if it's stored in another place...
